# Drone-vs-Bird
An application powered using machine learning for classifying,
identifying, and tracking drones and birds based on their trajectories (temporal
information) and physical appearance (spatial information) from the frames. Developed
in Python. Around 350+ drone and bird trajectory data were collected from various sources
which were mined to get a decision boundary to classify as drone vs bird.
